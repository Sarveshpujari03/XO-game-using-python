# XO-game-using-python
The XO Game project is a Python-based implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game designed to run in a command-line interface (CLI). It offers both single-player and multi-player modes, providing entertainment for users looking to challenge themselves against an AI opponent or compete with friends directly from the terminal.
